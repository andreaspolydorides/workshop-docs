Following an interview process with multiple wheelchair users, seating comfort of manual chairs was identified as a common need. I have since designed some prototypes that are meant to be DIY (“do it yourself”). Getting these prototypes to finished designs, I need to better understand what format they need to be distributed at. Are they better served as a simple “DIY” kit? Are they simple enough to source and assemble individually by users?\nWhat is the aim of this workshop? The aim of this workshop is to understand how users with making experience, interact with my prototypes. Through your experience assembling this prototype we can hopefully identify any design weaknesses or different ways of doing things.\nWhat do I need to do before we get started? Please make sure to read through the participant information and complete the consent form which can be found here. You will not be able to take part without completing these.\nSo what happens now? Now we will go through three tasks needed to complete the DIY project that we believe people with making experience should be able to complete. No worries if you don’t have making experience specific to each task, a learning segment is included before each task. We will begin with soldering,",

    "content": "This task will require you to hand-solder a number of components onto a PCB, simulating the process of building a design called LoopOne.\nLoopOne LoopOne is an open-source design that aims to alleviate thermal discomfort among wheelchair users. It works by circulating water through a tube in the wheelchair’s cushion for a cooling or heating effect which the user can control as required. In addition to improving the user’s comfort, thermally regulating the seat temperature can minimise the risk of pressure sores.\nI’ve designed a custom circuit board (PCB) which handles all necessary functions for this design:\nHeating and cooling the water (this is done through a small component called a Peltier module) Circulating the water (this is done through a water pump) Sensing water flow (this is a safety measure to ensure any bends in the tube do not increase pressure and put unnecessary strain on the water pump) Sensing temperature and humidity (this allows us to monitor multiple points for pressure and humidity, which in turn allows the user to set up custom settings to suit their needs) Connecting fans (this is an optional add-on where users can choose to add air fans to either blow air through the cushion or toward the user in hot/humid weather) Connecting additional sensors (this takes the form of an I2C port, which DIY-minded users can use to to incorporate additional sensors of choice) Why do I need to solder? In the spirit of keeping this design as financially accessible as possible, we are testing whether it would be possible for those with ‘making’ skills to hand-solder larger components to a PCB themselves. This results in a significantly lower cost compared to purchasing a PCB with all required components pre-assembled by the manufacturer.",

The design is essentially a lattice of varying density, with areas that are subject to high pressure using a lower density lattice and vice versa. As these cushions can be made with most standard consumer-level 3D printers, they can be more affordable as well as geographically and financially accessible.\n3D Printing Compared to purchasing a cushion from a shop, 3D printing one is probably outside of most people’s comfort zone. Though it’s easier than ever to access a 3D printer, with many hobbyists owning one and printers generally available in most makerspaces, the process may still seem daunting for inexperienced makers or anyone not quite confident enough to troubleshoot or resolve any issues. For this reason, we are asking participants to configure and begin a print of their personalised 3D printed cushion.",
