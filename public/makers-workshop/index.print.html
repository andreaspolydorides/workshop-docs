<h1 id="makers-workshop">Makers Workshop</h1>

<p>This workshop is part of my PhD research in DIY assistive technology (DIY-AT). Following an interview process with multiple wheelchair users, seating comfort of manual chairs was identified as a common need. I have since designed some prototypes that are meant to be DIY (&ldquo;do it yourself&rdquo;). Getting these prototypes to finished designs, I need to better understand what format they need to be distributed at. Are they better served as a simple &ldquo;DIY&rdquo; kit? Are they simple enough to source and assemble individually by users?</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-aim-of-this-workshop">What is the aim of this workshop?</h2>
<p>The aim of this workshop is to understand how users with making experience, interact with my prototypes. Through your experience assembling this prototype we can hopefully identify any design weaknesses or different ways of doing things.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-i-need-to-do-before-we-get-started">What do I need to do before we get started?</h2>
<p>Please make sure to read through the participant information below and then complete the consent form which can be found <a href="https://forms.office.com/e/cgwBuu0Yjh" rel="external" target="_blank">here</a>. Upon completion alert the researcher running the session.</p>

You are being invited to take part in a research project. Before you decide it is important for you to understand why the research is being done and what participation will involve. Please take time to read the following information carefully and ask us if there is anything that is not clear or if you would like more information. Take time to decide whether or not you wish to take part.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What is the project’s purpose?</strong>
The purpose of this workshop is to observe wheelchair users with some making experience build DIY assistive technology (DIY-AT), and understand what part of the design, dissemination or making process can be improved and how.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Why have I been chosen?</strong>
You have been chosen because you expressed a willingness to participate in this study and meet the inclusion criteria of being an adult wheelchair user with making experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Do I have to take part?</strong>
Taking part in the study is entirely voluntary. If you do decide to take part, you will receive this information sheet by email and asked to complete the consent form below. You can withdraw at any time without giving a reason.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What will happen to me if I take part?</strong>
You will be asked to participate in an in-person workshop, where you will follow web-based instructions to perform a series of making-related tasks, namely sourcing components for a DIY project, soldering, coding, and 3D printing. The primary researcher and two other participants will be present during the study and will be in conversation with you as you proceed through the tasks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Will I be recorded and how will the recorded media be used?</strong>
The workshop will be video-recorded so that the researcher can analyse each participant&rsquo;s experience and identify any common themes. An anonimysed transcript will be created based on the audio recording and pictures will be selected from the video. The pictures will be used for publications and presentations. The video will then be deleted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What are the possible disadvantages and risks of taking part?</strong>
This research poses no risk greater than that which you would encounter during your other making activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What are the possible benefits of taking part?</strong>
You may learn a new making skill from the tasks you have to complete. By participating in this study, you help us improve the process of DIY-AT design.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What if something goes wrong?</strong>
If you wish to raise any issues relating to this research, please contact Professor Yvonne Rogers who is the Principal Researcher on the project, at <a href="mailto:y.rogers@ucl.ac.uk" rel="external" target="_blank">y.rogers@ucl.ac.uk</a>. You can also contact the Chair of the UCL Research Ethics Committee, at <a href="mailto:ethics@ucl.ac.uk" rel="external" target="_blank">ethics@ucl.ac.uk</a>, should you feel your concern has not been handled to your satisfaction (e.g. by the PR or the supervisor).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Will my taking part in this project be kept confidential?</strong>
All the audio information that we collect from you during the course of the research will be transcribed and anonymised. The audio will then be permanently deleted. However, it will be possible to identify you in pictures of any ensuing reports or publications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Limits to confidentiality</strong>
Please note that every effort will be made to keep your information confidential and to present it in an anonymised format. All personal data will be immediately decoupled from any responses provided. However, you should also note that the nature of your responses – if specific to your studies or work – may mean that you can be indirectly identified from the responses you provide. Please note that confidentiality will also be maintained as far as it is possible, unless during our conversation I hear anything which makes me worried that someone might be in danger of harm, I might have to inform relevant agencies of this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What will happen to the results of the research project?</strong>
Information of the training data will be processed and included in the researcher’s MSc dissertation thesis, and maybe in an academic journal publication if possible. You can review your own training data instantly after finishing your daily training. Where possible, we will be willing to share the overall results with you either by providing copies of documents and papers (subject to any privacy/data protection restrictions) and/or by inviting you to participate in an online feedback seminar. The results will help us inform the design of this innovative multimodal language learning system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Who is organising and funding the research?</strong>
This PhD research is funded by the Department of Computer Science at University College London (UCL).</p>

<h1 id="soldering-pcb-components-task">Soldering PCB Components Task</h1>

<p>This task will require you to hand-solder a number of components onto a PCB, simulating the process of building a design called LoopOne.</p>
<h2 id="loopone">LoopOne</h2>
<p>LoopOne is an open-source design that aims to alleviate thermal discomfort among wheelchair users. It works by circulating water through a tube in the wheelchair’s cushion for a cooling or heating effect which the user can control as required. In addition to improving the user&rsquo;s comfort, thermally regulating the seat temperature can minimise the risk of pressure sores.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve designed a custom circuit board (PCB) which handles all necessary functions for this design:</p>
<ul>
<li>Heating and cooling the water (this is done through a small component called a Peltier module)</li>
<li>Circulating the water (this is done through a water pump)</li>
<li>Sensing water flow (this is a safety measure to ensure any bends in the tube do not increase pressure and put unnecessary strain on the water pump)</li>
<li>Sensing temperature and humidity (this allows us to monitor multiple points for pressure and humidity, which in turn allows the user to set up custom settings to suit their needs)</li>
<li>Connecting fans (this is an optional add-on where users can choose to add air fans to either blow air through the cushion or toward the user in hot/humid weather)</li>

<h2 id="why-do-i-need-to-solder">Why do I need to solder?</h2>
<p>In the spirit of keeping this design as financially accessible as possible, we are testing whether it would be possible for those with &lsquo;making&rsquo; skills to hand-solder larger components to a PCB themselves. This results in a significantly lower cost compared to purchasing a PCB with all required components pre-assembled by the manufacturer.</p>

<h2 id="uploading-and-configuring-firmware">Uploading and Configuring Firmware:</h2>
<ol>
<li>The firmware for the Raspberry Pi Pico on your PCB is based on a programming language called CircuitPython. To upload our code we need to prepare the Pico to accept CircuitPython code. If you&rsquo;re using a Pico, download this, and if you&rsquo;re using a Pico W, download this. If you&rsquo;re unsure which Pico you have, check the pictures below.</li>
<li>Now click <a href="static/firmware-files/test.py" download="test.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> to download the firmware. If you want to have a look at what it does, it&rsquo;s on our Github.</li>
<li>Keep the bootsel button pressed as you connect the Pi Pico to the computer. The button is showed below.</li>
<li>The Pico should now show up as a drive in your computer&rsquo;s file manager name &ldquo;RPI-RP2&rdquo; or something similar.</li>
<li>Drag the Circuitpython (.uf2) file to the &ldquo;RPI-RP2&rdquo; drive. Note you should drag the CircuitPython file and not the firmware.</li>
<li>The drive should reset and should now appear as &ldquo;CIRCUITPYTHON&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Now to finish off, drag the firmware file we downloaded to the &ldquo;CIRCUITPYTHON&rdquo; drive.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="testing-firmware">Testing Firmware:</h2>
<ol>
<li>In Visual Studio Code (VS Code), navigate to Extensions (Command/Ctrl+Shift+X) and install the &lsquo;Serial Monitor&rsquo; extension by Microsoft</li>
<li>With the Raspberry Pi Pico connected and with the code uploaded to it, open a new terminal (within VS Code) and switch to the Serial Monitor tab</li>
<li>You should be seeing temperature values if all is going well. If you are not, check that:
<ul>
<li>the Raspberry Pi Pico is showing up as a Circuitpython device,</li>
<li>the &ldquo;.py&rdquo; file is in the base directory as you open it up,</li>
<li>the code itself has print statements. e.g.: <code>print(f&quot;Temperature: {temp:.1f}°C&quot;)</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<h1 id="3d-print-a-personalised-cushion">3D Print a Personalised Cushion</h1>

<h2 id="opencushion">OpenCushion</h2>
<p>OpenCushion is a project that allows users to customise and 3D print wheelchair cushions using flexible materials, with the aim of evenly distributing pressure and minimising discomfort and the risk of pressure sores. The design is essentially a lattice of varying density, with areas that are subject to high pressure using a lower density lattice and vice versa. As these cushions can be made with most standard consumer-level 3D printers, they can be more affordable as well as geographically and financially accessible.</p>
<h2 id="3d-printing">3D Printing</h2>
<p>Compared to purchasing a cushion from a shop, 3D printing one is probably outside of most people&rsquo;s comfort zone. Though it&rsquo;s easier than ever to access a 3D printer, with many hobbyists owning one and printers generally available in most makerspaces, the process may still seem daunting for inexperienced makers or anyone not quite confident enough to troubleshoot or resolve any issues. For this reason, we are asking participants to configure and begin a print of their personalised 3D printed cushion.</p>
