    <title>3D Print a Personalised Cushion :: PhD Workshop</title>
    <link>http://localhost:1313/makers-workshop/printing/index.html</link>
    <description>OpenCushion OpenCushion is a project that allows users to customise and 3D print wheelchair cushions using flexible materials, with the aim of evenly distributing pressure and minimising discomfort and the risk of pressure sores. The design is essentially a lattice of varying density, with areas that are subject to high pressure using a lower density lattice and vice versa. As these cushions can be made with most standard consumer-level 3D printers, they can be more affordable as well as geographically and financially accessible.</description>
