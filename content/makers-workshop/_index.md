This workshop is part of my PhD research in DIY assistive technology (DIY-AT). Following an interview process with multiple wheelchair users, seating comfort of manual chairs was identified as a common need. I have since designed some prototypes that are meant to be DIY ("do it yourself"). Getting these prototypes to finished designs, I need to better understand what format they need to be distributed at. Are they better served as a simple "DIY" kit? Are they simple enough to source and assemble individually by users?

## What is the aim of this workshop?
The aim of this workshop is to understand how users with making experience, interact with my prototypes. Through your experience assembling this prototype we can hopefully identify any design weaknesses or different ways of doing things.

## What do I need to do before we get started?
Please make sure to read through the participant information below and then complete the consent form which can be found [here](https://forms.office.com/e/cgwBuu0Yjh). Upon completion alert the researcher running the session.

## Participant Information

This workshop is being conducted as part of a UCL PhD degree. This project has been approved by the UCL Ethics Board, Project ID: UCLIC_2024_003_Rogers. All data will be handled in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) and will be anonymised. If you decide to share contact information for further studies, this will be kept separate from the data collected. Only the researcher running the session will have access to the data. You will not be identifiable in any publications that may arise from this data.

1. **Invitation:**
You are being invited to take part in a research project. Before you decide it is important for you to understand why the research is being done and what participation will involve. Please take time to read the following information carefully and ask us if there is anything that is not clear or if you would like more information. Take time to decide whether or not you wish to take part.

2. **What is the project’s purpose?**
The purpose of this workshop is to observe wheelchair users with some making experience build DIY assistive technology (DIY-AT), and understand what part of the design, dissemination or making process can be improved and how. 

3. **Why have I been chosen?**
You have been chosen because you expressed a willingness to participate in this study and meet the inclusion criteria of being an adult wheelchair user with making experience. 

4. **Do I have to take part?**
Taking part in the study is entirely voluntary. If you do decide to take part, you will receive this information sheet by email and asked to complete the consent form below. You can withdraw at any time without giving a reason.

5. **What will happen to me if I take part?**
You will be asked to participate in an in-person workshop, where you will follow web-based instructions to perform a series of making-related tasks, namely sourcing components for a DIY project, soldering, coding, and 3D printing. The primary researcher and two other participants will be present during the study and will be in conversation with you as you proceed through the tasks. 

6. **Will I be recorded and how will the recorded media be used?**
The workshop will be video-recorded so that the researcher can analyse each participant's experience and identify any common themes. An anonimysed transcript will be created based on the audio recording and pictures will be selected from the video. The pictures will be used for publications and presentations. The video will then be deleted. 

7. **What are the possible disadvantages and risks of taking part?**
This research poses no risk greater than that which you would encounter during your other making activities.

8. **What are the possible benefits of taking part?**
You may learn a new making skill from the tasks you have to complete. By participating in this study, you help us improve the process of DIY-AT design.

9. **What if something goes wrong?**
If you wish to raise any issues relating to this research, please contact Professor Yvonne Rogers who is the Principal Researcher on the project, at y.rogers@ucl.ac.uk. You can also contact the Chair of the UCL Research Ethics Committee, at ethics@ucl.ac.uk, should you feel your concern has not been handled to your satisfaction (e.g. by the PR or the supervisor).

10. **Will my taking part in this project be kept confidential?**
All the audio information that we collect from you during the course of the research will be transcribed and anonymised. The audio will then be permanently deleted. However, it will be possible to identify you in pictures of any ensuing reports or publications.

11. **Limits to confidentiality**
Please note that every effort will be made to keep your information confidential and to present it in an anonymised format. All personal data will be immediately decoupled from any responses provided. However, you should also note that the nature of your responses – if specific to your studies or work – may mean that you can be indirectly identified from the responses you provide. Please note that confidentiality will also be maintained as far as it is possible, unless during our conversation I hear anything which makes me worried that someone might be in danger of harm, I might have to inform relevant agencies of this.

12. **What will happen to the results of the research project?**
Information of the training data will be processed and included in the researcher’s MSc dissertation thesis, and maybe in an academic journal publication if possible. You can review your own training data instantly after finishing your daily training. Where possible, we will be willing to share the overall results with you either by providing copies of documents and papers (subject to any privacy/data protection restrictions) and/or by inviting you to participate in an online feedback seminar. The results will help us inform the design of this innovative multimodal language learning system.

13. **Who is organising and funding the research?**
This PhD research is funded by the Department of Computer Science at University College London (UCL).
