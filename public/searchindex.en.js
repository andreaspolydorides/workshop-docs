    "content": "The ‘SVG Modifier’ Approach This method takes advantage of a ‘modifier geometry’ feature available in some slicers including Prusaslicer. This allows us to introduce 3D shapes which can interact with the 3D model to modify settings like speed, temperature or line widths. In addition to standard shapes like cubes and cylinders, the modifier geometry feature can also work with SVG files, which we can shape any way we need. If we look at a pressure map like the one below, we can split pressure values into areas and assign different densities to each one. If we can create SVG drawings of each area we can overlay them over our cushion 3D model as modifier geometry and create cushions that go some way toward distributing pressure. This approach is not personalised but is a step forward in improving comfort over standard cushions.\nA simplified pressure map example. Usually there are more areas.\nAn ’exploded’ view of the pressure map ‘area’ stack.\nSoftware Needed (check if they are pre-installed) Inkscape Prusaslicer (enable the “Ultimaker S line” printers in the configuration assistant) Instructions Choose one of the areas from the pressure map above. Given our time constraints you will work with only one today. In Inkscape, select the Bezier tool. This is different to a classic paint tool, this is how it works: When you first Left-Click on the canvas you set the first point. From the move to where you want your curve to end. If you don’t wish to set a curve to your line just Left-Click again to set a straight line. To add a curve, Left-Click and hold - moving the mouse around now induces a curve. When you’re done release the left mouse button. Repeat until you’re back at the start. When you want to end the area, you can click back on that first point (it is the square icon at the start of your line) to create one final connecting line. Note The rules on creating a curved line apply to the last one as well. So if you need a curve, Left-Click and hold. Once you’re satisfied with your shape, select the path and click on the export tab indicated below. Make sure the export directory is somewhere you can easily access and select to export the path as an SVG file. Now on to slicing, launch Prusaslicer. In the printer preset select Ultimaker S5/S7. If no Ultimaker option is selected use the Configuration Assistant to add the preset. While the cushions are made with TPU, the S5 printers don’t handle that too well so we’ll be using PLA for this study. Go ahead and select ‘Generic PLA’ for both Filament slots. For print settings pick ‘O.25mm DRAFT’, you’ll see the most progress on your print with this! Now go into ‘Print Settings’ \u003e ‘Layers and perimeters’ and for ‘Perimeters’, ‘Top solid layers’ and ‘Bottom solid layers’ to 0. In the ‘Infill’ section of ‘Print Settings’, you can swap between ‘Fill patterns’ to see the different lattices. ‘Gyroid’ is particularly good for cushions. Now download here cushion model, and import it to Prusaslicer. Resize it to make it fit. At this point you can click slice to check you are on the right track. The lattice should be visible from all angles. Right-Click on the cushion model and select ‘Add modifier’ \u003e ‘SVG’ and load the SVG file you created in Inkscape. Left-Click on the SVG and change its height (Z axis) to match or exceed the height of the cushion. Now Right-Click the SVG modifier, select ‘Infill’ and change the infill density to a percentage density different to that of the cushion. Finally if you connect a USB drive, Prusaslicer should let you export the GCODE instructions to it. Once that’s done, eject the drive and bring it over to the 3D printer. Ensure there are no prints in the printer and that the print head is clean, now navigate to the file in the USB drive and start the print!",

Please take time to read the following information carefully and ask us if there is anything that is not clear or if you would like more information. Take time to decide whether or not you wish to take part.\nWhat is the project’s purpose? The purpose of this workshop is to observe wheelchair users with making experience as they build DIY assistive technology (DIY-AT) and to understand what part of the design, dissemination or making process can be improved and how.\nWhy have I been chosen? You have been chosen because you expressed a willingness to participate in this study and meet the inclusion criteria of being an adult wheelchair user with previous making experience.\nDo I have to take part? Taking part in the study is entirely voluntary. If you decide to take part, you will receive this information sheet by email and will be asked to complete the consent form below prior to the beginning of the workshop. You can withdraw at any time without giving a reason.\nWhat will happen to me if I take part? You will be asked to participate in an in-person workshop where you will follow web-based instructions to perform a series of making-related tasks, namely sourcing components for a DIY project, soldering, coding, and 3D printing. The primary researcher and two other participants will be present during the study and will be in conversation with you as you proceed through the tasks.\nWill I be recorded and how will the recorded media be used? The workshop will be video-recorded so that the researcher can analyse each participant’s experience and identify any common themes. An anonymised transcript will be created based on the audio recording and pictures will be selected from the video. The pictures will be used for publications and presentations. The video will then be deleted.\nWhat are the possible disadvantages and risks of taking part? This research poses no risk greater than that which you would encounter during your other making activities. If you wish to skip any tasks, you are free to do so without it affecting your participation in the rest of the study and any compensation you may be eligible for.\nWhat are the possible benefits of taking part? By participating in this study, you help us improve the process of DIY-AT design so that users of varying making expertise can have access to DIY assistive technology. Additionally, you may learn a new making skill from the tasks you have to complete.\nWhat if something goes wrong? If you wish to raise any issues relating to this research, please contact Professor Yvonne Rogers who is the Principal Researcher on the project, at y.rogers@ucl.ac.uk. You can also contact the Chair of the UCL Research Ethics Committee, at ethics@ucl.ac.uk, should you feel your concern has not been handled to your satisfaction (e.g. by the PR or the supervisor).\nWill my taking part in this project be kept confidential? All the audio information that we collect from you during the course of the research will be transcribed and anonymised. The audio will then be permanently deleted. It will not be possible to identify you in pictures included in any ensuing reports or publications as faces will be blurred.\nAre there limits to this confidentiality? Please note that every effort will be made to keep your information confidential and to present it in an anonymised format. All personal data will be immediately decoupled from any responses provided. However, you should also note that the nature of your responses – if specific to your studies or work – may mean that you can be indirectly identified from the responses you provide. Please note that confidentiality will also be maintained as far as it is possible, unless during the conversation the researcher hears anything which makes them worried that someone might be in danger of harm, the researcher might have to inform relevant agencies of this.\nWhat will happen to the results of the research project? The workshop transcript, and experiences of the participants will be processed and included in the researcher’s PhD thesis, and possibly an academic publication. The outcome of this workshop will help improve how DIY-AT is designed for makers of all expertise levels.\nWho is organising and funding the research? This PhD research is funded by the Department of Computer Science at University College London (UCL).\nThank you for reading this information sheet and for considering taking part in this research study.\nPlease make sure to complete the consent form",

In the spirit of keeping this design as financially accessible as possible, we are testing whether it would be possible for those with ‘making’ skills to hand-solder larger components to a PCB themselves.

The design is essentially a lattice of varying density, with areas that are subject to high pressure using a lower density lattice and vice versa. As these cushions can be made with most standard consumer-level 3D printers, they can be more affordable as well as geographically and financially accessible.\n3D Printing Compared to purchasing a cushion from a shop, 3D printing one is probably outside of most people’s comfort zone. Though it’s easier than ever to access a 3D printer, with many hobbyists owning one and printers generally available in most makerspaces, the process may still seem daunting for inexperienced makers or anyone not quite confident enough to troubleshoot or resolve any issues. For this reason, we are asking participants to configure and begin a print of their personalised 3D printed cushion.\nI have come up with three ways in which we can create personalised cushions:\nUsing Python and a library called FullControl we can turn a pressure map into a 3D printable cushion model. This doesn’t require and CAD or slicer software typically used in 3D printing. Using slicer software we slice a 3D model of a cushion, with only the lattice (infill) structure. Using Python and the pressure map we then personalise the density of the previously generated GCODE. For users without access to a pressure map, a third way of creating a cushion, involves using a feature of modern slicing software and SVG drawings of pressure maps. This is the method you will be focusing on in the workshop, proceed to the task page to learn more.",
