      <description>A Workshop on the Making Journey of DIY-AT for Wheelchair Seating Comfort. This workshop is part of my PhD research in DIY assistive technology (DIY-AT). Following an interview process with multiple wheelchair users, seating comfort of manual chairs was identified as a common need. I have since designed some prototypes that are meant to be DIY (“do it yourself”). Getting these prototypes to finished designs, I need to better understand what format they need to be distributed at. Are they better served as a simple “DIY” kit? Are they simple enough to source and assemble individually by users?</description>
