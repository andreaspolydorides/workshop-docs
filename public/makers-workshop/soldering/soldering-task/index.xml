    <description>Have you done the required reading? It’s here&#xA;Tools and Parts Needed: Soldering Iron Soldering Wire Tip Cleaner Flux Tinner PCB Screw Terminal (black, 2-pin) Inductor (grey cylinder, 2-pin) JST-XH connectors Soldering helper (choose from 3D printed jig, masking tape, or “helping hands”) Soldering Task Instructions: Assemble the tools and components needed for soldering Prepare PCB for soldering with soldering setup of choice. Affix the screw terminal on the PCB with a “helping hand” or with some masking tape. Be mindful of its orientation. Note If you are using the 3D printed soldering jig, you want to start with the shortest component we will be soldering today, the JST-XH connectors. Verify the orientation and solder the component to the PCB. Now try to solder more components.</description>
